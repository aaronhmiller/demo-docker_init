# Hello World using Deno (node sorted, get it?)

This app features:

- Oak framework, which is similar to Express.js but built for Deno
- Two routes:
  - `/` - Returns a simple JSON response
  - `/hello` - Returns an HTML page with basic styling
- Basic request logging middleware
- Server running on port 8080

You can access the app at:

- http://localhost:8080/ for the JSON response
- http://localhost:8080/hello for the HTML page
