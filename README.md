# Demo `docker init`

Learned about the new feature from this [cool post](https://livingdevops.com/devops/docker-init-to-write-dockerfile-docker-compose/).

## Notes

to make it work, had to add `gunicorn` to the requirements.txt

and there were some casing issues to report re: the Dockerfile (that were reported to them to be a good netizen)
